    "# Counting Objects in OpenCV.\n",
    "Well done traveller, welcome back to the bus ride. This episode involves counting simple objects in a picture. We have an image containing some shapes, and in this lesson, we would identify, locate and  count the number of shapes in the image. During this process, we would 1) Learn how to convert images to grayscale 2) detecting Edges 3) Thresholding the grayscale image 4) Finding, counting and drawing contours 5) performing erosion and dilation 6) masking an image.\n",
